# BandwagonHost Launches POWERBOX Series: Triple-Network CN2 GIA Return, 2.5Gbps Bandwidth Starting at $41.9/Year

---

Looking for a VPS with serious bandwidth and rock-solid China connectivity? BandwagonHost just dropped their new POWERBOX lineup, and it's actually interesting. We're talking 2.5Gbps pipes, CN2 GIA return routes for all three major Chinese carriers, and pricing that doesn't require selling a kidney. If you've been dealing with congested routes or wimpy bandwidth caps, this might be worth your attention.

So BandwagonHost decided to shake things up again. After rolling out their MINIBOX and BIGGERBOX series last year, they're back with something new: the **POWERBOX-30-1536** package. This isn't just another "me too" VPS offering—they actually thought about what matters.

Here's the setup: it lives in their DC99 data center, which honestly sounds like a robot's name, but whatever. What matters is the routing. You get CN2 for China Telecom outbound, direct connections for China Mobile and China Unicom, and here's the kicker—CN2 GIA return routes for all three carriers. That 2.5Gbps bandwidth isn't just marketing fluff either; it's actually there.

The interesting part? No invitation code required. Just go buy it. Annual pricing sits at **$41.95**, and they take PayPal, Alipay—basically the usual suspects. It's refreshing when things just work without jumping through hoops.

## What You're Actually Getting

Let's talk specs without the fluff:

**Test IP**: 45.62.113.*

The DC99 node delivers that fat bandwidth pipe and CN2 GIA return routing we mentioned. But here's the trade-off: you can't switch data centers. You're locked to DC99. For some people, that's a dealbreaker. For others who just want solid China connectivity in one spot, it's fine.

## Why BandwagonHost Keeps Showing Up

BandwagonHost isn't some fly-by-night operation. They're part of IT7, which has been around since 2004—ancient history in internet years. They run KVM-based VPS hosting across a ridiculous number of locations: multiple US cities (Los Angeles, New Jersey, New York, Fremont), Canada, Netherlands, Hong Kong, Japan. You get the picture.

What sets them apart is they actually optimize for China mainland connectivity. Not just as an afterthought—it's baked into their infrastructure. 👉 [Need reliable China-optimized VPS hosting without the usual headaches?](https://bandwagonhost.com/aff.php?aff=79616) They offer Hong Kong CN2 GIA, Tokyo CN2 GIA, LA CN2 GIA, Canada CN2 GIA, and Japan Softbank routes. That's not a small selection.

### Hong Kong – CN2 GIA Options

Their Hong Kong presence runs on CN2 GIA, which if you've dealt with China connectivity before, you know matters. A lot. The difference between CN2 GIA and regular routing is like the difference between a highway and a dirt road during rush hour.

### Tokyo – CN2 GIA Options

The Tokyo nodes follow the same philosophy. CN2 GIA routing means your traffic doesn't crawl through congested peering points. It just works, which is kind of the point.

## Bottom Line

The POWERBOX series represents BandwagonHost doing what they do best: providing solid infrastructure with China-friendly routing at prices that don't make you wince. The 2.5Gbps bandwidth is real, the CN2 GIA return routing actually makes a difference for Chinese users, and the $41.95 annual price point is competitive. Sure, you can't switch data centers, but if DC99's location works for you, that's not really a problem. 👉 [Check out BandwagonHost's current offerings and see if POWERBOX fits your setup](https://bandwagonhost.com/aff.php?aff=79616)—sometimes the straightforward option is the right option.
